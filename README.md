# üåê State of Math: Progressing Math Education

Welcome to the **State of Math**, an open-source repository dedicated to documenting and improving the way math is taught and learned. This is an effort to track historical methods, evaluate current practices, and explore innovative approaches to create a better foundation for math education worldwide.

## üìò What We Do Now

Math education is the backbone of many disciplines, but the way we teach and learn it often varies significantly by region, era, and even individual schools. Currently:
- **Standards and Curricula**: Different regions follow diverse standards (e.g., Common Core, Singapore Math), which reflect a mix of traditional and research-based methods.
- **Documentation**: Updates to curricula and methods are poorly centralized, often explained only in isolated policy documents or academic papers.
- **Pedagogy**: Teaching methods range from rote memorization to exploratory problem-solving, with no consistent tracking of their effectiveness.

While there are pockets of innovation, the broader system remains fragmented, making it difficult to evaluate what works and why.

## üöß Why It‚Äôs Problematic

This fragmented approach has several challenges:
1. **Lack of Historical Context**:
   - Methods and approaches are phased out without clear documentation or explanation, leaving parents, educators, and students disconnected from the "why" behind the changes.
   - Useful older methods can be lost or misunderstood.

2. **Inefficiency and Redundancy**:
   - Researchers and educators often "reinvent the wheel" because past experiments and pilot programs aren‚Äôt centralized or easily accessible.
   - Time and resources are wasted duplicating efforts.

3. **Equity Issues**:
   - Not all schools or regions can access or implement newer, research-backed approaches, leaving some students behind.
   - Numerals and methods optimized for accessibility (e.g., for dyscalculia or dyslexia) aren‚Äôt widely adopted.

4. **Missed Opportunities for Innovation**:
   - Improvements to learner experience and teaching strategies remain underexplored despite potential benefits.
   - Cross-discipline integrations, such as using computational thinking in math, are slow to gain traction.

5. **Resistance to Change**:
   - Parents and educators often resist new methods due to a lack of clarity or evidence, perpetuating a cycle of confusion and skepticism.

## üõ†Ô∏è How This Repo Will Help Solve This Problem

This repository aims to create a centralized space to document, evaluate, and innovate in math education. Here‚Äôs how:

### 1. **Track the Evolution of Math Education**
   - **Documentation**: Maintain detailed records of current and past methods, including why they were adopted or deprecated.
   - **Historical Context**: Provide educators, parents, and policymakers with easy access to the rationale behind changes in curricula.
   - **Changelogs**: Regular updates and milestones to keep track of progress and discussions.

### 2. **Foster Innovation and Experimentation**
   - **Streamlined Systems**: Explore and prototype changes that improve characteristics like consistency and accessibility.
   - **Interactive Tools**: Provide resources for testing new methods in classrooms, such as lesson plans, demos, and data visualizations.
   - **Global Collaboration**: Allow contributors from diverse regions and disciplines to propose and evaluate ideas.

### 3. **Enable Data-Driven Decision-Making**
   - **Research Integration**: Link teaching methods to evidence from cognitive science and pedagogy research.
   - **Feedback Loops**: Collect and analyze data from classrooms piloting new ideas, ensuring a continuous improvement cycle.

### 4. **Promote Equity and Accessibility**
   - **Localized Adaptations**: Allow educators to fork branches and tailor curricula to their specific needs while retaining access to shared resources.
   - **Accessibility Focus**: Advocate for infrastructure and teaching methods designed for inclusivity.

### 5. **Engage the Community**
   - **Parents and Educators**: Provide clear, accessible explanations of changes in math education to bridge the generational gap.
   - **Open Contributions**: Use pull requests, discussions, and issue tracking to crowdsource ideas and improvements.
